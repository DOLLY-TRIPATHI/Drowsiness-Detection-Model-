Drowsiness Detection Model ðŸ’¡

The Drowsiness Detection Model is a computer vision and deep learningâ€“based system designed to monitor a driverâ€™s alertness in real-time and prevent road accidents caused by fatigue. The model processes live video feed from a camera, detects the driverâ€™s face and eyes, and analyzes whether the eyes are open or closed.

If the eyes remain closed beyond a certain threshold, the system identifies this as a sign of drowsiness and immediately triggers an alert mechanism (sound alarm or visual warning) to wake the driver.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:

Real-time monitoring using webcam or in-car camera.

Face & eye detection with OpenCV and deep learning (CNN/YOLO).

Classification of eye states (open/closed) using trained model.

Alert system (buzzer, sound, or on-screen warning) when drowsiness is detected.

Accident prevention by ensuring driverâ€™s alertness.

ðŸ”¹ Applications:

Smart vehicles for driver safety.

Fleet management systems.

Intelligent transport solutions.
